  intro: `
    My name is Simone and I am a Front-end developer.
    During my university studies I developed an interest in the world of web development,
    which led me to discover React. After graduating in Computer Science at the University of Cagliari,
    I decided to dive deep into Front-end development, learning React and its main stack technologies.

  subtext: `
  My main goal is to create good looking user interfaces which are intuitive and simple to use to the end user.
  I try to focus on writing clean code using the best practices, paying attention to the smallest details.

  I always look forward to learn new technologies and to get better at the ones I already know. 
  Even though my main focus is currently on Front-end development, I also learned some of the basics of 
  Back-end development.
